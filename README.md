## Time Series Forecasting for Airline Flight Departure Delays Using Neural Networks

The goal of this study is to predict particularly the length of time of future flight departure delays using standard recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and/or 1D-CNN-LSTM models.  The data was published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the US Department of Transporation, and is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset contains flight information from 2009 to 2018.
