# Project 3 Proposals

## Proposal 1: 

## Working Title: Time Series Forecasting for Airline Flight Departure Delays Using Neural Networks

The goal of this study is to predict particularly the length of time of future flight departure delays using strandard recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and/or 1D-CNN-LSTM models.  The data was published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the US Department of Transporation, and is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018.

* The dataset contains flight information from 2009 to 2018.
* Three airlines would be chosen for comparison.

Another option is to first predict whether flight would be delayed, and then length of time that the flight is going to be delayed for departure, as delayed flights are likely to result in delayed arrival.


## Proposal 2:
Dataset: Airfares in New Zealand (https://www.kaggle.com/shashwatwork/airfares-in-new-zealand)

The goal of this study is to predict future domestic airfare pricing in New Zealand using flight information from September to December of 2019.  Neural network forcasting models would be used.  This dataset contains 162,833 entries overall.


## Proposal 3:
Dataset: January Flight Delay Prediction (https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/flight-delay-prediction)

The goal of this study is to use time series forcasting neural network models to predict US flight delays in the month of Janurary.  This dataset includes over 1,000,000 combined entries, and contains flight information from January of 2019 and 2020.
