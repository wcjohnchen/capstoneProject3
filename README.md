## Working Title: Time Series Forecasting for Airline Flight Departure Delays Using Neural Networks

The goal of this study is to predict particularly the length of time of future flight departure delays using strandard recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and/or 1D-CNN-LSTM models.  The data was published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the US Department of Transporation, and is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018.

* The dataset contains flight information from 2009 to 2018.
* Three airlines would be chosen for comparison.

Another option is to first predict whether flight would be delayed, and then length of time that the flight is going to be delayed for departure, as delayed flights are likely to result in delayed arrival.
